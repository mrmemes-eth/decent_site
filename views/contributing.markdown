# Yes, please!

`decent_exposure` is Open Source Software (licensed under the [WTFPL][wtfpl],
if you're curious) and it thrives and grows as a result of your contributions!

If you're interested in contributing code, please be familiar with [git][git],
[ruby][ruby] and [behavior driven development][bdd].

## General pointers

We've established some coding conventions over the years, so please take
queues from the source itself and consider it authoritative. Outside of that,
you'll want to make sure that:

* tab characters should be converted into spaces
* tab level is 2 characters
* methods that take arguments use parens
* test all changes, test all additions, ensure the suite passes afterwards

I can't stress the last point enough. We will not accept untested changes.

## Other ways to contribute:

### Report bugs

If you experience a problem with the software, please peruse the list of
[issues][issues] we maintain on Github. If you see an issue chime in and let
us know it's a problem for you too. If you do not see an issue that describes
the problem you've experienced, please add one.

With bug reports, the more information the better. Please explain the
specifics of your environment, including:

* Ruby version
* Rails version
* Steps to reproduce
* Other gems/software that may be involved

For more info on good bug reports, please see Simon Tathan's excellent _[How
to Report Bugs Effectively][bugs]_.

### Provide documentation

The [wiki][wiki] is open to anyone with a [github][ghub] account. If you've
found a weird interaction with another library, or want to share a wiz-bang
strategy you made or found, this is the place to do it.

If you'd like to add `RDoc`, that'd be a wonderful contribution and I would be
happy to (re)name my dog after you. She's older, but seems to respond well enough
when I call her odd names, so she'll probably take it in stride.

If you see typos, code errors, errors of omission or anything else that is
wrong/hard-to-understand/dumb, please let us know by adding a bug at our
[issue tracker][issues]
